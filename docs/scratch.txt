MTF Challenge

Challenge 1 - Participation
Athletes will receive points(tokens) by participating at MTF events.
At the MTF event there will be at least one computer available(provided by MTF)
to allow the Athletes to check-in. Athletes can check-in to an event by either
loging on the web interface with thier username/password which contains their
account or scan their QR code(code is an address to a contract wallet).

- MTF is able to verify who attended these events 
- Athletes are able to earn tokens in their accounts


Challenge 2 - Security XXXX
Identities are protected and users use an online alias in public

XXXX Not doing this one

Challenge 3 - Donations
A system where donors can fund MTF. They have the option of choosing which
projects their funds go to. Using a partially fungible token they should be
able to see where their funds end up in a transparent way through the
blockchain. 

Challenge 4 - Monetary conversion
Tricky?

Challenge 5 - Exchange
Interface for vendors to accept points in exchange for goods/services.
Scenario:
1. user logs on website using user/pass
2. goes to the vendor page, finds a hockey stick they'd like to buy from Nike
for 100 tokens.
3. user confirms and the tokens are sent from user(athlete)'s account to Nike's
account. 
4. Nike gets notification of that transaction, they can check/verify that it is
correct through the blockchain. They give the hockey stick to that user
(directly if user is in a store, mail it to address user provides-maybe saved
in their account?)
5. When Nike wants to cash out the tokens, they send it to MTF. MTF can verify
that Nike sent them 100 tokens to cash out from the blockchain. 
6. MTF then initiates the cashout process which is :
  - Burn 100 tokens so they are no longer in circulation.
  - Send $100 to Nike from MTF's fund account to Nike's bank fund account.
